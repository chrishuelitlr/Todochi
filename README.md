# Todochi
Todochi is a local C++ web application that provides a task management dashboard. This project was made with the intention of learning C++.

# Tech Stack
C++ for the backend to develop and test the web server, router, and utility functions
Vanilla Javascript for a static frontend

# Web Application Role
With the purpose of managing your tasks, Todochi will allow a user to create, manage, and delete tasks. 

Create a Task feature:
- Consists of the Title of Task, Category of Task (optional), and Time Spent doing Task (optional), and a description (optional)

Manage a Task feature:
- Add reminders for a task (Specific Time/Date), Priority (Dashboard will prioritize on dashboard)
- Create a repeating agenda for the week/month that contains Tasks, showing your progress bar on the dashboard


Delete a Task feature:
- User will delete a task which will reside in the history section 

AI feature: TBD

# Phase 1: Web Server Implementation
The web server will be implemented in C++ and will handle network connections and HTTP requests/responses with a Server class.

## main.cpp

- Start the server, bind to a port, accept incoming requests, and delegate those requests to your Router or Server classes

## server.hpp, server.cpp, test_server.cpp

- Handle socket creation and binding, accept connections, read/parse raw HTTP requests, send back responses via HTTP server loop in server.cpp
- Pass parsed requests to your Router class in router.cpp
- Test to confirm server is listening and accepting connections and see a browser hit the server to get a basic response (OK 200) 


## router.hpp, router.cpp
- Match URL paths and HTTP methods
- Call the appropriate handler logic (load task list, add new task)

üìå Prompt to Paste Tomorrow:

Hi! I‚Äôm working on a C++ web server project for local use. My project structure includes directories like src/, include/, www/, and Data/. The goal is to build a web server that supports a to-do list, event/calendar features, and (maybe later) user accounts. Right now, I want to focus only on implementing the core web server functionality ‚Äî handling incoming HTTP requests and responses.

I‚Äôve already planned to put the main server loop inside server.cpp, route logic in router.cpp, and start the server in main.cpp. I also have the appropriate headers (server.hpp, router.hpp) set up with include guards.

Can you help me start coding the server logic in server.cpp, beginning with the setup and HTTP loop?




# Phase 2: Web Application Implementation

The web application will handle basic CRUD operations for Task objects with local-user support
üõ†Ô∏è Phase 1: MVP for Local Use
	‚Ä¢	Basic web server handling GET/POST
	‚Ä¢	HTML interface to:
	‚Ä¢	Add tasks
	‚Ä¢	Mark complete/delete
	‚Ä¢	View history
	‚Ä¢	Store data in a file (JSON, CSV, or plain text)

üß≠ Phase 2: Add Calendar + Notifications
	‚Ä¢	Calendar view
	‚Ä¢	Event creation with time
	‚Ä¢	Local notification system (background thread or log output)

üßë‚Äçüíª Phase 3: Modular Design for Future Auth
	‚Ä¢	Abstract the ‚Äúuser‚Äù concept in your data model (even if it‚Äôs just one user)
	‚Ä¢	Start separating frontend/backend logic

üîê Phase 4 (Optional): Add Authentication
	‚Ä¢	Login/register pages
	‚Ä¢	Password storage (use hashing like bcrypt or Argon2)
	‚Ä¢	Session or token system
